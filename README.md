## 💡 Key Insights & Sales Strategies from Dashboard
1. High Spending Categories

Insight: Categories such as Bills, Entertainment, and Fuel exhibit higher transaction volumes and amounts.

Action:
- Partner with top vendors in these categories for exclusive credit card offers or cashback.
- Create category-specific reward programs to incentivize usage.


2. Low Usage Customers

Insight: A segment of customers (like those in the 20-30 and 60+ age group) either make very few transactions or remain inactive.

Action:
- Run reactivation campaigns for these users as limited-time bonuses or discounts.
- Offer EMI or balance transfer promotions to increase engagement.
  

3. Customer Segmentation

Insight: Certain customer demographics (age groups, credit limits, city-wise data) show higher usage patterns.

Action:
- Tailor marketing campaigns for active segments.
- For low-performing segments, offer beginner-friendly cards or educational content to build trust.
  

4. Credit Limit Utilization

Insight: Some users frequently utilize a high percentage of their credit limit.

Action:
- Target these customers with credit limit increase offers.
- Suggest premium cards with better limits and rewards.
  

5. Transaction Frequency Trends

Insight: There are noticeable peaks during certain months (festive seasons, sales, etc.).

Action:
- Pre-plan marketing offers and cashback events just before these spikes.
- Use Power BI alerts to notify the sales team of upcoming patterns.
  

6. Declining or No-Use Cards

Insight: A percentage of cards are not used after activation.

Action:
- Conduct a win-back campaign with "use within 7 days and get ₹500 cashback" type offers.
- Simplify onboarding and usage instructions for new users.
  

7. Geographic Hotspots

Insight: Certain states (Texas, New York, California, etc) have higher credit card penetration and usage.

Action:
- Focus on underperforming regions through regional partnerships and offers.
- Increase visibility via targeted digital ads in low-usage areas.
