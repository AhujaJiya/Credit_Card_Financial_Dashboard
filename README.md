## 💡 Key Insights & Sales Strategies from Dashboard
🔍 1. High Spending Categories
Insight: Categories such as Bills, Entertainment, and Fuel exhibit higher transaction volumes and amounts.

Action:
- Partner with top vendors in these categories for exclusive credit card offers or cashback.
- Create category-specific reward programs to incentivize usage.

📍 2. Low Usage Customers
Insight: A segment of customers (like those in the 20-30 and 60+ age group) either make very few transactions or remain inactive.

Action:
- Run reactivation campaigns for these users as limited-time bonuses or discounts.
- Offer EMI or balance transfer promotions to increase engagement.

👥 3. Customer Segmentation
Insight: Certain customer demographics (age groups, credit limits, city-wise data) show higher usage patterns.

Action:
- Tailor marketing campaigns for active segments.
- For low-performing segments, offer beginner-friendly cards or educational content to build trust.

🧾 4. Credit Limit Utilization
Insight: Some users frequently utilize a high percentage of their credit limit.

Action:
- Target these customers with credit limit increase offers.
- Suggest premium cards with better limits and rewards.

📈 5. Transaction Frequency Trends
Insight: There are noticeable peaks during certain months (festive seasons, sales, etc.).

Action:
- Pre-plan marketing offers and cashback events just before these spikes.
- Use Power BI alerts to notify the sales team of upcoming patterns.

📉 6. Declining or No-Use Cards
Insight: A percentage of cards are not used after activation.

Action:
- Conduct a win-back campaign with "use within 7 days and get ₹500 cashback" type offers.
- Simplify onboarding and usage instructions for new users.

🌐 7. Geographic Hotspots
Insight: Certain states (Texas, New York, California, etc) have higher credit card penetration and usage.

Action:
- Focus on underperforming regions through regional partnerships and offers.
- Increase visibility via targeted digital ads in low-usage areas.
